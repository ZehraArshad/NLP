## N-gram modelling

### Bi gram
- pair of words to compute next word probability


### Tri gram
- triple words to compute next word


### N grams

If grams increased, chances of predicting most freq will increase because now we have context.

### Word Emebeddings

- TFIDF
- Word2Vec

### Text Classification

- Some words contribute more. Therefore, we assign weights to them
